**We are currently trying to review these challenges to prepare them for addition to the Free Code Camp curriculum expansion. We need your help!**

[View the challeges in the live app](http://hysterical-amusement.surge.sh/) | [View the map of the curriculum](https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module/blob/master/CHALLENGE_MAP.md)

**We need campers to provide feedback specifically in these areas:**

- The content of each challenge explains the topic well
- There are no grammatical errors in the content
- The tests are clear and function properly
- Each individual challenge functions correctly without any bugs :sweat_smile:

In addition, we tried to create a nice flow to the overall narrative of the challenges. If you work through several in sequence, try to reflect on how well the challenges perform consecutively.

##To Submit Your Feedback:##

The easiest way to submit feedback on a challenge is to **open an issue** here on the repository. Title it with the name of the challenge. Then, provide your feedback in the issue and we'll open a discussion to deal with it. If you have any general comments, [you can share them here](https://github.com/bonham000/fcc-react-tests-module/issues/17).

Alternatively, you can fork and edit the repository directly and submit a pull request if you are comfortable doing that. However, it will be best to at least open a discussion about the changes you want to make unless you find something that unambiguously needs to be changed.
