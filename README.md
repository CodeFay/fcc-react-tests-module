To run this project locally, clone the repository, install the dependencies, and run `npm start`. Now you can view all the finished challenges live in the browser.

This project is running tests against React components, ES6 code, and plain JavaScript which users write directly into a browser code editor. To accomplish this we are using the [Babel standalone package](https://github.com/babel/babel-standalone) to transpile JavaScript and the testing library [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) to conduct tests. The tests we're writing for React components generally look like this:

```javascript
assert.strictEqual(shallowRender.type(), 'div', 'The component renders a div element');
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
