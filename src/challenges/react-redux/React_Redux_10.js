export const challengeText = `<span class = 'default'>Intro: </span>Congratulations! You've finished the lessons on
React and Redux. One more thing before moving on. You typically won't be writing React apps in a code editor like this.
In this lesson we've provided a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if you're working with npm and a file system on your 
own machine. Aside from the use of <code>import</code> statements which we use to pull in all of the dependencies that we've
been providing as global objects here, everything else should look pretty similar. Take a look at the code and see if you
can follow what's going on.<br><br>

Finally, writing React and Redux code tends to require some configuration. This can tend to get complicated quickly. If
you are interested in experimenting on your own machine, we recommend

<a id='CRA' target ='_blank' href='https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app'>Create React App</a>

which comes configured and ready to go out of the box. You can also enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in CodePen, add
React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well. Congratulations on making it this far, you've learned a lot!`
